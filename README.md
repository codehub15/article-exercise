## HTML
I think there is kind of an abuse of the id tag. I usually work with class, and only use id if I must (but that's just my opinion).
Instead of <span class="bold">, I would have just used the <strong> tag. You can also make it bold with the <b> tag (same thing for italics).

## CSS
I believe the document would be clearer, if you add comments for the sections. For example /* Layout */, /* Body */, /* Typography*/, etc.
I really like the CSS code in general. I looks very clean, and it's just what we need. Congrats :)
